# Project Name

## Overview
This project is a modern web application built using [framework/technologies like React, Vue, etc.]. It leverages Vite for fast development and builds, ensuring a smooth developer experience.

## Available Scripts
The following scripts are available in the `package.json` for various development and production tasks:

### Development

- **`npm run dev`**
  - Runs the Vite development server with the `development` mode.
  - This mode may have specific configurations suited for more extensive development testing.

### Building for Production
- **`npm run build:dev`**
  - Builds the application using the `development` mode configuration.
  - Useful for testing a production-like build without full production optimizations.

- **`npm run build`**
  - Builds the project for production with optimized settings.
  - The output is stored in the `dist` directory, ready to be deployed.

### Code Linting
- **`npm run lint`**
  - Runs ESLint on the entire project with specified extensions (`.js`, `.jsx`).
  - The `--report-unused-disable-directives` flag ensures unused ESLint directives are reported, and `--max-warnings 0` makes the build fail on any warnings.
  - Use this command to maintain code quality and follow coding standards.

### Previewing
- **`npm run preview`**
  - Starts a server to preview the built application.
  - This is used to test the production build locally before deploying.
